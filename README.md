Project Template: Offline Web-Application published via GitHub-Pages [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hannes-hochreiner/project-template-offline-gh-pages.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hannes-hochreiner/project-template-offline-gh-pages)
====================================================================

For some time I have been interested in the idea of writing offline web applications.
What is fascinating to me, is how the measning of visiting a web site changes.
With offline applications the first visit is an install and every subsequent visit (while connected to the net) is just a check for updates.
To me, this is like turning the whole web into an app store.

I understand that offline web-applications are not the right answer to all problems, but in this project, I would like to explore such a model using a simple demo application.
